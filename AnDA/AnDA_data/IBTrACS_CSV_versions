*** IBTrACS_V8:
- Same as V7;
- 3 columns added: vmx_obs, rmx_obs and r34_obs, corresponding to all SAR, RAD, SCT observations. For each time step t, the nearest observation in an interval [t - 1.5, t + 1.5] is taken, if it exists. 

*** IBTrACS_V7:
- Code upgraded;
- Timestep is 3-hrs; 
- U and V dropped; 
- Selection is from t = 17 m/s to  = LMI.

*** IBTrACS_V6: 
- With Rmax_ck22_corrected, to capture the strong decreasing at the beginning and then the stagnating. 

*** IBTrACS_V5: 
- All storms go from t34 (=time when storm reached 34 kts) to t_star.

*** IBTrACS_V4: 
- Uses ds_int, where all storms are calibrated to go from 20 time steps before to t_star (=90% of LMI).
