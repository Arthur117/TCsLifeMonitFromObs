*** IBTrACS_V6: 
- With Rmax_ck22_corrected, to capture the strong de decreasing at the beginning and then the stagnating. 

*** IBTrACS_V5: 
- All storms go from t34 (=time when storm reached 34 kts) and t_star.

*** IBTrACS_V4: 
- Uses ds_int, where all storms are calibrated to go from 20 time steps before to t_star (=90% of LMI).
