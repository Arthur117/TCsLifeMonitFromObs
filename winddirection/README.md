- 01_getSARasymmetries
Computes asymmetry parameters on a filtered dataset of (~100) SAR images
Takes ~8 hours to run

- 02_plotKepertAndSARasymmetries
Builds on the previous dataset to plot the SAR asymmetries
Also computes and plots the asymmetry metrics for the Kepert model
Takes ~8 hours to run

- 03: TODO: Fit the K values from Kepert to the SAR data once I have identified the cases (or the case!?) on which I will do it 
i.e look at VWS before;
