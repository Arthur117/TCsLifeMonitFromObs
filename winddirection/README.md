# winddirection

- 01_getSARasymmetries
Computes asymmetry parameters on a filtered dataset of (~100) SAR images
Takes ~8 hours to run

- 02_plotKepertAndSARasymmetries
Builds on the previous dataset to plot the SAR asymmetries
Also computes and plots the asymmetry metrics for the Kepert model
Takes ~8 hours to run

- 03: TODO: Fit the K values from Kepert to the SAR data once I have identified the cases (or the case!?) on which I will do it 
i.e look at VWS before;

- bebinca, bheki1, bheki2, leslie, usagi: tests with Kepert and IWRAP;

- larry_z: most advanced notebook containing the up-do-date Kepert 2001 functions, and some tests with IWRAP and EarthCARE;

- test_asymmetry_windshear: asymmetry diagnostics from SAR only;

- test_asymmetry_kepert: asymmetry diagnostics from Kepert 2001 only;
